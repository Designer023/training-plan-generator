# Training plan generator

This set of scripts generates a training plan based on a set of criteria. It's been designed for medium experiend runners (eg a few half marathons and regular running). The range is currently tailored to progress from around half marathon distance up to marathon/50k. There is 2 weeks of tapering before race week (3 in total).

## Analysis

### Existing plans

#### Hal Higdon sample

```
Mon:  REST
Tues: Start 5km - 10km (incrementing througout plan ) // GENTLE - don't push the pace Alternatly! FEEL Not watch!
Weds: Start 8km - 16km  (increment by week 10) // Midweek longer run - Push at the end if you're feeling good
Thurs: 5km - 10km + core / strength / flexibility
Fri: REST
Sat: 8km marathon pace or 10k 8@ultra pace // Pace work day
Sun: 16km // Long day (30 % of total week)
```

```
1.6 km every second week until you reach a peak of 16km

##### Long
Tempo - a tempo run (e.g. 5 miles at half marathon race pace)
high-intensity intervals (e.g. 5 x 1,000 meters at 5K race pace
If you're training for a 5K, the high-intensity interval workout should be the toughest.
If you're training for a 10K or half marathon, emphasize the tempo run.
And if it's a marathon you're preparing for, test yourself most on the long runs.

## The "plan"

Remember, a plan is guideline and not the law. It is meant to keep you progessing in a steady way. Try to stick to it as closely as you can, but sometimes you may be having an off day so reduce or skip the day. There's always tommorrow to make it up and an injury won't help. Listen to your body. If you're in pain, slow down. If you're still in pain later go see a doctor or physio ASAP. Sometimes you might be feeling better so do a *little* more. Don't do more and break yourself!

when you get a third to half way in reevaluate the plan. If it doesn't work for you (to easy/hard/time consuming) then it's time to find another.

## Routines explained
### Shorter training runs

These are aimed at building base milege, recovery, and training at varied speeds and HR Zones. The aim is to use these to compliment your longer runs.


- Base
- Tempo
- HIT
- Parkrun

#### Short
A short run. Probably around 25-50% of your base/tempo run (which ever is shorter).

#### Base
A base run is aimed at getting more distance on your legs on a regular basis. This is especially important for new runners who's legs and body are not accustomed to running on a regular basis. As you become more experienced the number of base runs can decrease, with some being replaced with tempo runs or HIT runs and others being replaced *by a day off (rest day!)*.

#### Tempo
Tempo is a run that is at around 30s slower pace than your 5km race pace. So If you do a 5:00 race pace (30:00) you would be aiming for 5:30 (32:30). It should put you in the anaerobic threshold or lactate-threshold zone - The pace where your body can clear much of the lactate your muscles create burning energy which gives you dead leg sensation (fatigue). This is normally run in the 90% HR zone and you should be able to hold it for 20 mins with only minor discomfort. The benefits of this 

#### HIT*

HIT, or High Intensity Training is used to push your body into more uncomfortable zones in order to build your speed, stamina and endurance. This can vary depending what you are training for. Regular race targets will include intervals and HR-Zone training. For more hilly events the training should also include hill training and for endurance training this may include a day with 2 runs. 

* Not to be confused with HIIT (High intensity interval training) which is focued on non running activities. Our HIT covers interval training but not in the same way!

- Baisc intervals (various sets)
- Fartlek
- Kenyan 25 1 1
- HR Zone
- Hill training (various sets)
- Increase the pace (various sets)

Rather than go into detail about these here, we will detail them later on.

#### Parkrun
A park run can be used as a base, tempo or race paced run. See how you are feeling and where it slots in your plan.

### Longer training runs
These are used to push your endurance levels and drain your legs. They slowly build up the time and distance you can run. They are almost always run at a much slower pace than other runs (endurance zone).

- long
- double (2x)
- ultra
- recovery

#### Long
A normal long run. This is the longest run of the week. Run at endurance pace for anything over a 10km.

#### Double (2x)
A long run, albeit, ~75% shorter than your regular long run an your usual day, and on the neighboring day a much shorter but still long run ~50% normal distance. Usually a long run is a Sunday so on the Saturday a shorter-long run is completed. eg. Saturday 10km & Sunday 21km. The total for the 2 days will be a little over your normal long run distance ~25%.

#### Ultra

An even longer run in the range of 20-25% more than normal. The aim of this is to push your legs more than usual (in distance not pace). The preceding weeks training and next week generally have more recovery/rest days

#### Recovery

A long run, but much shorter - 50-65% of a normal long run.

### Final runs

These are the runs that build up to the race and the race itself. They are used to keep your body in condition, but not to drain it. You want to end up stacked with energy and raring to go on race day. If you arrive feeling drained you didn't taper hard enough!

- Taper
- Race

### Intervals

All intervals start with a warmup of a few minutes 5-10 and a cool down of a similar length.

#### Basic intervals

Can be time or distance based.

- Warmup then...
- Run at one of the below RPE for the matching distance/duration
    - 1000m at 4-6 RPE
    - 800m at 6-8 RPE
    - 400m at 8-9 RPE
    - 100m at 9-10 RPE
    - 3 mins at 6-8 RPE
    - 1-2mins at 8-9 RPE
    - 30-60s at 9-10 RPE
- Run for 1-2 mins at a recovery pace (a few less RPE than the sprint eg 8-9 -> 4-6, 4-6 -> 3-4)
- Repeat until you have covered a suitable number of reps depending on the size of the intervals - shorter intervals = more reps!
- Cooldown

#### Fartlek

Same as basic intervals but make it up as you go along usually by picking a landmark and uppin the pace to the landmark (RPE depending on the distance/time to the land mark). Then slower pace for a time and repeat

- Warmup then...
- Pick a landmark and up the RPE until the landmark
- Slow down the RPE until another landmark
- Repeat until you have covered a suitable number of reps depending on the size of the intervals - shorter intervals = more reps!
- Cooldown

#### Kenyan 25 1 1

It's 1 minute intervals, but 25 of them

- Warmup then...
- Set you watch to beep every minute...
- Run a really easy minute (4-5 RPE) 
- Run as fast as you can keep going (8-9 RPE). You should end this feeling like you can't go on any further (out of breath)
- Relax breath deep. You should just be feeling comfortable and...
- Repeat 25x
- Cooldown
